Adventure Works Sales Analysis Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer segmentation, product insights, and regional trends for Adventure Works.

##  Purpose
The Adventure Works Sales Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to evaluate sales revenue, profit performance, customer behavior, and product-level insights.
This dashboard enables business stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify high-performing categories, analyze regional sales distribution, and support data-driven strategic decisions.

## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and shaping.

• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create calculated measures such as Total Sales, Total Profit, MTD, YTD, and dynamic KPIs.

• Data Modeling – Relationships established between sales, customer, product, and territory tables for cross-filtering and aggregation.

• File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Data Source
Source: Microsoft Adventure Works Sales Dataset.

The dataset includes:

Sales transactions

Product categories and subcategories

Customer demographics (age group, gender)

Territory and country information

Monthly and yearly sales data

Profit and return details

The data is structured in a star schema format to support efficient reporting and analysis.

## Features / Highlights

• Business Problem

Adventure Works operates across multiple regions and product categories. Management needs a clear understanding of:

Which product categories drive the highest revenue and profit?
Which regions contribute the most sales?
How does profit compare to revenue across territories?
What are the monthly sales trends?
Which products generate higher returns?

Analyzing raw transactional data manually is time-consuming and inefficient.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that:

Monitors key sales and profit KPIs.
Tracks monthly and yearly performance (MTD and YTD).
Analyzes customer demographics and regional performance.
Identifies high-performing product categories and subcategories.
Evaluates product returns and profitability.
